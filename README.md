Creating my first repository

Hello everybody!

I'm starting in this world! I still don't have experience but I'm looking foward to learn and to be challenged!
I'm graduated in architecture and I've been working in my field but I was always the "geek" in my work. I started thinking about giving a try to IT because many of my friends, that are working in this field, said to me that I could be a good project manager, product owner or anything related. They said that because of my way of thinking, I'm always trying to make the things work in the easiest and best way.
I like to coordinate activities, to help the others to learn. 
However I don't have experience in the field, I have a lot of experience in managing constructions and they need to follow a process. I also needed to coordinate the teams working in the site. 
I already studied programming logic and Ruby. When I was younger I liked to create templates for blogs in HTML. 
I'm trying to get to know more about coding, data science, data analysis and so on. I know the importance of starting from the basics and I hope soon I'm able to get my fisrt opportunity.

Let's make it happen!
